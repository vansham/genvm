:term:`Sub-VM` Architecture
===========================

Overview
--------

GenVM is built on a modified WebAssembly runtime that enables the
execution of "Intelligent Contracts" - smart contracts capable of
performing both deterministic blockchain operations and
non-deterministic AI/web operations while maintaining consensus. The
VM's core innovation is its dual-mode execution model that isolates
deterministic and non-deterministic operations.

WebAssembly Foundation
----------------------

GenVM uses WebAssembly as its core execution environment,
providing:

-  **Language Agnostic Execution**: Support for multiple programming
   languages compiled to WASM
-  **Security**: Memory-safe execution with controlled access to system
   resources
-  **Performance**: Near-native execution speed with efficient
   compilation
-  **Portability**: Consistent behavior across different hardware
   architectures

VM Execution Modes
------------------

:term:`GenVM` uses dual execution model that separates deterministic and non-deterministic operations.

.. _gvm-def-det-mode:

Deterministic Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**: Executes blockchain consensus logic that must produce
identical results across all validators.

**Characteristics**:

- Reproducible execution across all network participants
- Access to blockchain state (storage, balances, ...)
- Standard computational operations and business logic
- Inter-contract communication and message passing

**Restrictions**: - No access to external networks or services -
Controlled randomness and time access - Software-based floating point
operations - No file system access beyond virtual file system

.. _gvm-def-non-det-mode:

Non-Deterministic Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**: Executes operations that may produce different results, so
that they require consensus validation.

**Characteristics**:

- AI inference and ML operations
- Web scraping and HTTP requests
- External data source access

**Isolation**: - Separate VM instance to prevent state contamination

- Results passed back to deterministic mode are leader-substituted
- No direct access to blockchain state
- No file system access beyond virtual file system
- Communication only through validated results

VM Instance Management
----------------------

Supervisor Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GenVM uses a supervisor pattern to manage multiple VM instances

**Resource Management**:

- Memory limits per execution mode (4GB for deterministic VMs, 4GB for non-deterministic VMs)
- Time gas metering and consumption tracking
- Execution timeouts

Memory Model
------------

Linear Memory Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each VM instance operates with WebAssembly's linear memory model.

**Memory Isolation**:

- Strict boundaries between VM instances
- No shared memory between deterministic and non-deterministic modes
- Strict memory allocation limits

Storage Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Storage operations
-  Custom :ref:`gvm-def-calldata-encoding` format for deterministic serialization

Gas and Resource Metering
-------------------------

GenVM implements a sophisticated three-dimensional gas model to ensure
fair resource allocation and prevent abuse.

Execution Modes
---------------

Leader Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a node acts as a leader:

1. **Full Execution**: Runs both deterministic and non-deterministic
   operations
2. **Result Proposal**: Proposes non-deterministic operation results to
   validators
3. **Consensus Participation**: Provides ground truth for validator
   verification

Validator Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a node acts as a validator:

1. **Deterministic Execution**: Runs consensus logic normally, using
   leader-provided results
2. **Non-Deterministic Validation**: Executes validator functions to
   verify leader results
3. **Consensus Voting**: Votes on acceptance of leader-proposed results

Validation Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multiple validation strategies for non-deterministic results are available

Error Handling
--------------

Error Categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Error Fingerprinting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Consensus Security**: When WebAssembly execution fails and backtraces
are enabled, GenVM automatically generates a cryptographic fingerprint
of the memory state to prevent nodes from cheating by skipping actual
execution.

**Cryptographic Hashing**: Uses BLAKE3 cryptographic hash function to
generate deterministic fingerprints of memory regions.

**Fingerprint Structure**:



**Components**:

- **Call Stack Frames**: Module name and function index for each frame in the call stack (:math:`0` corresponds to last frame where error occurred)
- **Memory Fingerprints**: BLAKE3 hash (32 bytes) of each WebAssembly memory region per wasm module, ordered as wasm memory indexes
- **Module Organization**: Fingerprints organized by wasm module instance name

**Result Format**: Error results with fingerprints are encoded in :ref:`gvm-def-calldata-encoding` as:

::

   {
     "message": "<error_message_string>",
     "fingerprint": <structured_fingerprint_data>
   }

**Coverage**: Fingerprinting applies to :ref:`gvm-def-vm-error` and :ref:`gvm-def-user-error` results but not :ref:`gvm-def-internal-error` cases.

**Anti-Cheating Mechanism**: Error fingerprints provide consensus
participants with proof that actual execution occurred up to the point
of failure, making it computationally infeasible for malicious nodes to
fabricate execution results without performing the actual computation.
